The following PromQL query returns CPU usage (as the number of used CPU cores) by pod in every namespace:

sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container!=""}[5m])) by (namespace, pod)
The container!="" filter is needed for filtering out cgroups hierarchy metrics - see this answer for details.

The following query returns memory usage by pod in every namespace:

sum(container_memory_usage_bytes{container!=""}) by (namespace, pod)
The following query returns CPU usage (as the number of used CPU cores) by node:

sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container!=""}[5m])) by (node)
The following query returns memory usage by node:

sum(container_memory_usage_bytes{container!=""}) by (node)
